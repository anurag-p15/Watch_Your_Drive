# Watch_Your_Drive

Hello...Everyone!!!
In this repsoitory I have created a game Watch Your Drive. It is a single player car driving game.
The game consist of a car which is being run by a player and he/she has to avoid collision with other cars that are coming from the opposite direction.
The player can move the car using the left and right arrow keys along the horizontal direction. 
As soon as the player leaves the road or collision takes place the game ends and the gaming window closes.

There will be some modifications in the game which will be done in due course of time.
Adios!!
