# Watch_Your_Drive

Hello...Everyone!!!
In this repsoitory I created the game Watch Your Drive is a single player car driving game which we all have played in our younger days.
The game consist of a car which is being run by a player and he/she has to avoid collision with other cars that are coming from the opposite direction.
The player can move the car using the arrow keys while he/she can only move the car along the horizontal direction. 
As soon as the player crosses the boundary of the road or collision takes place the game ends and the gaming window closes.
